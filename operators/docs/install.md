# Installing The SDK

The first step is to install the SDK. The SDK will help you build and deploy your Operator. The official doc can be found on the [github page](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#workflow); and I'd check there first for the latest.

## Prerequisites

See the [github page](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#workflow)

## Create an Operator

Now you can visit the [howto](../README.md) to create/install an Operator!
