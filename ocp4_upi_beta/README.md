# OpenShift 4.1 UPI Survival Guide

This is **NOT** a howto. This is a guide that will help you install OCP UPI (i.e. BareMetal (but works on VMs) install) for 4.1 rc4. OCP4.x requires more infra components than 3.x and makes a lot of assumptions. I will go over them here; but remember. These are **__HIGH LEVEL__** notes and assumes you know what you're doing.
