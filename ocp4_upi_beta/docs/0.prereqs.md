# Prereqs

This is probably the longest and most important part of this guide. The prereqs are "heavier" in this release. So I'll break it down into sections

[Infra](#infra)
[DHCP](#dhcp)
[DNS](#dns)
[Load Balancer](#lb)

## Infra

Create 6 "blank" VMs (or use BareMetal) for OpenShift itself (don't install an OS on this just yet)

* 3 Masters
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 16 GB RAM
  * 120 GB HD
* 2 Workers (I did 3; but 2 works)
  * 2 vCPUs
  * 8 GB RAM
  * 120 GB HD
* 1 Boostrap (you remove this after the install is done)
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 16 GB RAM
  * 120 GB HD

Create 1 VM for the LoadBalancer (I used CentOS 7 but any Linux will do)

* LoadBalancer VM
  * 2 vCPUs
  * 4 GB RAM
  * 30 GB HD

Create 1 VM for DNS (You can use Centos/Fedora/RHEL)

* DNS VM
  * 2 vCPUs (if using IDM use 4 vCPUs)
  * 4 GB RAM
  * 30 GB HD (if Using IDM set this to 50GB HD)

If you don't have a lot of resources you can combine the LB and DNS server but I don't recommend it. If you don't have enough resources buy another server/box.  See the [min requirements](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#minimum-resource-requirements_installing-bare-metal) for OpenShift 4...it's a BEAST!

## DHCP

Right now, with rc4, you can't set static ip addresses with the installer. So "static" DHCP

## DNS

OCP4 uses SRV recrods for autodiscovery. More information can be found [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-dns-user-infra_installing-bare-metal)

## LB

## Conclusion

Do the following commands to check everything

__DNS__

```
```

__LB__

```
```
